# Forensics

## Verify
Flag: `picoCTF{trust_but_verify_c6c8b911}`
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.

```
$ ssh -p 50605 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net
```

```
ctf-player@pico-chall$ find files -type f -exec ./decrypt.sh {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -oiE picoctf{.+}
```

## Scan Surprise
Flag: `picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_3f7cf1ae}`
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?

```
zbarimg flag.png 2>/dev/null | grep -oiE picoctf{.+}
```

## Secret of the Polyglot
Flag: `picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_724b1287}`

The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?

Opening the pdf file shows the 2nd part of the flag. To find the other flag, I ran the file command on the file and found out that it's a valid PNG file. Copying the file with a PNG file extension reveals the other half of the flag.
```
$ file *
flag2of2-final.pdf: PNG image data, 50 x 50, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
$ cp flag2of2-final.pdf image.png
```

## CanYouSee
Flag: `picoCTF{ME74D47A_HIDD3N_deca06fb}`

How about some hide and seek?

Opening the image doesn't show the flag so I ran exiftool on the image and found a base64 code. Decoding the code reveals the flag.

```

## PcapPoisoning
Flag: `picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_4624a8b6}`

How about some hide and seek heh?

Specting the pcap file using wireshark doesn't do so much so I ran the strings command on the file and luckily I got the flag.

```
$ strings trace.pcap | grep -ioE picoctf{.+}
picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_4624a8b6}
```

## hideme
Flag: `picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_within_@n_ima9e_d55982e8}`

Every file gets a flag.
The SOC analyst saw one image been sent back and forth between two people. They decided to investigate and found out that there was more than what meets the eye here.

Running strings on the file, I noticed that it contains a hidden png file inside it. Running unzip command on the file reveals the flag.

## FindAndOpen
Flag: `picoCTF{R34DING_LOKd_fil56_succ3ss_494c4f32}`

Someone might have hidden the password in the trace file.
Find the key to unlock this file. This tracefile might be good to analyze.

We are given a pcap and a zip file. Opening the pcap file, I noticed that the packets contains a lot of base64 code. So I ran strings command on the pcap file, sorting it, and getting the uniq values to find uncommon base64 code. Decoding the longest base64 code reveals the password for the zip file. Extracting the zip file with the reveals the flag.

```
$ strings dump.pcap | sort | uniq

## St3g0
Flag: `picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}`

Download this image and find the flag.

Running strings, exiftool, and binwalk on the file doesn't reveal flag. Suddenly I remembered that you can hide data using the LSB approach. With that I ran the the zsteg command and got the flag.

```
$ zsteg pico.flag.png | grep -ioE picoctf{.+}
picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}
```

## Sleuthkit Intro
Flag: `picoCTF{mm15_f7w!}`

Download the disk image and use mmls on it to find the size of the Linux partition. Connect to the remote checker service to check your answer and get the flag.
Note: if you are using the webshell, download and extract the disk image into /tmp not your home directory.

```
$ mmls disk.img
DOS Partition Table

Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description

$ echo "202752" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 59234
202752
What is the size of the Linux partition in the given disk image?
Length in sectors: Great work!
picoCTF{mm15_f7w!}
```

## Redaction gone wrong
Flag: `picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully}`

Now you DONâ€™T see me.
This report has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

Opening the file, we can see that some of the text are redacted. But I noticed that you can still select the text that has been removed. So I copied the contents of the pdf and it shows the flag.

```

## Packets Primer
Flag: `picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_ceccaa7f}`

Download the packet capture file and use packet analysis software to find the flag.

Inspecting the packets, I noticed that the flag is in the data of the packet no. 4. But each character of the flag is delimited a space so I extracted the flag using tshark to automate the removal of spaces.

![2](/assets/posts/picoctf/forensics/2.png)

```
$ tshark -r network-dump.flag.pcap -Tfields -edata.data | xxd -r -p | tr -d ' '
picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_ceccaa7f}
```

## Lookey here
Flag: `picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}`

Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it.

Opening the file, I noticed that it contains a lot of text so I use grep command to find the flag in the file.

```
$ grep -ioE picoctf{.+} anthem.flag.txt
picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}
```

## File types
Flag: 

This file was found among some files marked confidential but my pdf reader cannot read it, maybe yours can.

## Enhance!
Flag: `picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_d0a757bf}`

Download this image file and find the flag.

Calling strings on the file, I noticed that the flag is inside span the span tag. So I used string manipulation to extract the flag.

```
$ strings drawing.flag.svg | tail
         y="132.11147"
         style="font-size:0.00352781px;line-height:1.25;fill:#ffffff;stroke-width:0.26458332;"

         id="tspan3752">c 3 d _ d 0 a 7 5 7 b f }</tspan></text>
  </g>
</svg>
```

```
$ strings drawing.flag.svg | grep span3 | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d'<' -f1 | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -d ' ' && echo
picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_d0a757bf}
```

## information
Flag: `picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}`

Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag? cat.jpg

Running exiftool on the image, I noticed that there's a base64 code as it's license. Decoding the code outputs the flag.

```
$ echo 'cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9' | base64 -d
picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}
```

## Disk, disk, sleuth! II

## Wireshark doo dooo do doo...
Flag: `picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef}`

Can you find the flag? shark1.pcapng.

Inspecting the packets, I noticed most of the HTTP packets are encrypted but one isn't, so I extracted the text in the HTML. After extracting, I noticed that the text are encrypted using caesar cipher.

![3](/assets/posts/picoctf/forensics/3.png)

## Wireshark twoo twooo two twoo...
Flag: `picoCTF{dns_3xf1l_ftw_deadbeef}`

Can you find the flag?

Inspecting the pcap file, I noticed a lot of http get requests requesting for **/flag**. Following the http streams gave random flags. After trying a few and failing, I noticed a strange dns query for the domain **reddshrimpandherring**. Filtering all dns queries I noticed that all of them have strange subdomains that also resembles base64. I also noticed that some of all of the dns comes from two ip source. First from **8.8.8.8** which is Google's dns server and the other unfamiliar ip which is **18.217.1.57**. So I tried extracting all the subdomains from the suspicious IP using tshark and parsed the data using gnu tools before decoding it using base64.

```
$ tshark -r shark2.pcapng -Y "dns.flags.response == 1" -Y "ip.src == 18.217.1.57" -T fields -e dns.qry.name | grep -v ^$ | cut -d'.' -f1 | uniq | tr -d '\n' | base64 -d && echo
picoCTF{dns_3xf1l_ftw_deadbeef}

## extensions
Flag: `picoCTF{now_you_know_about_extensions}`

This is a really weird text file TXT? Can you find the flag?

Upon opening the text file, I noticed that it contains NULL bytes so it must be a binary file. So I ran the file command on the file and found out that it's actually an image file. Saying that, I copied the file into a png file and got the flag.

```
$ file flag.txt
flag.txt: PNG image data, 1697 x 608, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced

$ cp flag.txt flag.png

The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications?
Set the timestamps on this picture to 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. In this example, +00:00 is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: 1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00. For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time (+00:00). The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each.
